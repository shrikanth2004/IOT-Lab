# IoT Lab Experiments Repository

This repository contains a collection of 12 Internet of Things (IoT) lab experiments.

## Repository Structure

Each experiment is organized into its own folder. Inside each folder, you will find two files:
1.  An image file showing the circuit connection diagram.
2.  A code file with the source code for the experiment.

## Experiments

1.  **Blink 5 LEDs:** Develop a program to blink 5 LEDs back and forth.
2.  **Smart Street Light:** Develop a program to deploy a smart street light system using an LDR sensor.
3.  **Gas Leakage Detection:** Develop a program to detect gas leakage in the surrounding environment.
4.  **Waste Classification:** Develop a program to classify dry and wet waste with the Moisture sensor (DHT22).
5.  **Keypad Interfacing:** Develop a program to simulate interfacing with the keypad module to record the keystrokes.
6.  **Interface Relay with Arduino:** Develop a program to interface a relay with an Arduino board.
7.  **DC Motor Control:** Develop a program to control a DC motor with an Arduino board.
8.  **Water Level Detection:** Develop a water level depth detection system using an Ultrasonic sensor.
9.  **Intrusion Detection System:** Develop a program to deploy an intrusion detection system using Ultrasonic and sound sensors.
10. **pH Value Reader:** Develop a program to read the pH value of various substances like milk, lime, and water.
11. **Weather Station:** Develop a program to demonstrate weather station readings using Arduino.
12. **UART Protocol:** Develop a program to set up a UART protocol and pass a string through the protocol.
