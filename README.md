# IoT Lab Experiments Repository

This repository contains a collection of 10 Internet of Things (IoT) lab experiments.

## Repository Structure

Each experiment is organized into its own folder. Inside each folder, you will find two files:
1.  An image file showing the circuit connection diagram.
2.  A code file with the source code for the experiment.
